What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique, and a type of artificial intelligence (AI), that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence
Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicilty programmed to do so

ML has other subs such as 
1. Supervised Learning:
   - is a type of ML learning where samples from a dataset has a corresponding label or output value; used to predict cell types or identify objects in an image
2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. 
3. Reinforced Leaning:
  - the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning
