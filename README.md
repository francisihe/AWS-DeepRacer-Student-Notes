## What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique, and a type of artificial intelligence (AI), that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence
Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicilty programmed to do so

ML has other subs such as 
### 1. Supervised Learning:
   - is a type of ML learning where samples from a dataset has a corresponding label or output value; used to predict cell types or identify objects in an image
### 2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. 
### 3. Reinforced Leaning:
  - the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning

=======================
Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:

1. A machine learning model
2. A model training algorithm
3. A model inference algorithm

1. A machine learning model - a machine learning model is a block of code or framework that can be modified to solve different but related problems based on the data provided. *A model is an extremely generic program (or block of code), made specific by the data used to train it. It is used to solve different problems.*

2. A model training algorithm - they work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.

3. A model inference algorithm - is used to generate predictions using a trained model.
